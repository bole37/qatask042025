This is a Public repository for the QA Task, for VortexWest.

Testing is done on the demo application of Jira Clone: https://jira.trungk18.com/project/board

1.Test Kanban Filter - Search bar
2.Test Kanban Filter - Filter by Ignore Resolved
3.Test Kanban Socials - Support button and URL
4.Test Kanban Tasks - Create issue
5.Test Kanban Tasks - Edit issue
6.Test Kanban Tasks - Move issue to another column
7.Test Kanban Tasks - Delete issue
8.Test Kanban Tasks - Check if Save button is disabled
9.Test Kanban Tasks - Check if successful popup is visible
10.Test Kanban Tasks - Edit Project Settings

The repo contains separate .pdfs for Automation and Manual test cases that are not implemented for automation. (https://github.com/bole37/qatask042025/tree/main/test-cases-pdf) 
Those were made using free to use clone for creating test cases. (https://app.qase.io)
